title: SQLAlchemy 2.0.0b1 Released

We are pleased to announce that the first beta release of
**SQLAlchemy 2.0** is now available.

The 2.0 series represents over three years of effort towards
updating SQLAlchemy's usage model and architectures for modern Python
use.  The update's origins lie within the three major Python paradigms that
came into existence well after SQLAlchemy's first releases in 2006:
Python 3, pep-484 typing support, and asyncio.  It's also in response to the
changing nature of the Python programming community, vastly larger and
home to many new developers with higher standards for strictness, ease of use
and documentation than was the case sixteen years ago.

While the SQLAlchemy 1.4 series introduced the major architectural changes to
internals, including the integration of Core SQL constructs within the
ORM, full SQL caching support, and asyncio support, the SQLAlchemy 2.0 series
now capitalizes on this architecture within many areas, including most
prominently:

* Complete pep-484 typing support and native compatibility with typing tools
  such as mypy, pylance, including annotation-based Declarative models and
  fully typed SQL statements (make sure you uninstall all ``sqlalchemy-stubs``,
  ``sqlalchemy2-stubs`` packages)
* Vastly more performant INSERT behavior within the ORM
* Vastly more performant table reflection architecture
* Integration of pure SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE statements including
  RETURNING of objects, upsert within normal ORM use

SQLAlchemy 2.0 also finalizes a very large number of API changes
first introduced in 1.4.     As such, even though SQLAlchemy 1.4 provided
a `very comprehensive <https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/changelog/migration_20.html>`_
upgrade path, we expect there to be lots of issues within the beginning of
the series, both as projects accommodate the changes as well as for users
of the new features, in particular the Declarative annotation support.
We therefore hope that the beta series will have lots of testing done, and
we will likely move from beta releases into release candidates as well,
anticipating a 2.0 final release after some months.
