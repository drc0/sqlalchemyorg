title: SQLAlchemy 1.4.14 Released
author: Mike
---

SQLAlchemy 1.4.14 is now available.

Release 1.4.14 includes deprecation paths for some API behaviors that
had inadvertently been removed.   It also includes a fix for the recently
modified "empty IN" behaviors, as well as support for calling ".commit()"
or ".rollback()" pre-emptively inside of transactional context managers.
Finally, an adjustment to ``TypeDecorator`` will render a warning that user-
defined ``TypeDecorator`` classes will want to "opt in" or "opt out"
of caching by applying a flag ``cache_ok=[True|False]`` to these classes.

Thanks to our users and developers for their continued support and efforts
on the project.
