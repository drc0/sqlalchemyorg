title: SQLAlchemy 1.4.28 Released

SQLAlchemy 1.4.28 is now available.

Release 1.4.28 adds new warnings emitted in the area of
statement caching involving third-party datatypes, SQL constructs, and
dialects, as user issues have revealed that the case of
SQLAlchemy's new statement caching being disabled may be more common
than was previously realized, and that this can also have a significant
performance impact compared to release 1.3 in the area of ORM lazy loading.
Previously, it was expected that 1.4 would be only modestly slower than
1.3 if statement caching were disabled, however ORM lazy loading and object
refreshes, which occur on attribute access, can be an exception if these
calls are very frequent.

For this reason, the new warnings will refer users to `new documentation
sections <https://sqlalche.me/e/14/cprf>` that describe the steps to take
when these warnings occur.

As is always the case, huge thanks to our user and contributor communities as
for their ongoing help and support as well as to our core team for their
dedicated efforts and hard work.
