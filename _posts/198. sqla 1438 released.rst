SQLAlchemy 1.4.38 is now available.

Release 1.4.38 is a bug fix release, covering a variety of use-case specific
issues.   One fix of note involves applications that make direct use of the
"lambda statement" construct as a replacement for "baked queries", where a
critical thread-oriented race condition that would cause cache corruption
specific to lambda statements has been fixed.

The complete changelog for 1.4.38 is at `Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_1_4_38>`_.

SQLAlchemy 1.4.38 is available on the `Download Page </download.html>`_.
