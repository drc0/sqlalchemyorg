SQLAlchemy 1.4.12 is now available.

Release 1.4.12 includes a variety of fixes including a SQL caching issue
involving certain forms of queries.  It also revises the format of the
"empty IN" comparison to no longer use subqueries for most platforms
which should eliminate compatibility and performance concerns that were
reported by users.   A fairly wide range of other bugs and regressions
are also fixed.

Huge thanks to our users for getting us the information needed for fixes
and to our growing development team for the great work!
