title: SQLAlchemy 2.0.0b3 Released

The third beta release of **SQLAlchemy 2.0** is now available.

The third beta release includes a range of fixes for SQLAlchemy's newest
feature, Annotated Declarative Mappings.    Full scale use of this feature
should hopefully be viable at this point as various issues regarding
imports across multiple files have been identified and resolved.


The first beta release just one week ago has seen unprecedented response for a
beta, with around 5000 downloads per day. Thanks to our users, in the past
seven days we've gotten about ten bug reports for small issues that have been
fixed in 2.0.b2.

Of note is a fix for SQL Server that affected
large string values, as well as a variety of rudimentary fixes for the new
annotation-based Declarative feature including dataclasses support.
