SQLAlchemy 1.4.17 is now available.

Release 1.4.17 fixes one mistake just released in version 1.4.16 regarding a
performance enhancement involving expressions such as ``select().join()``,
which could fail in certain uncommon calling circumstances brought to our
attention.

Thanks to our users and developers for their continued support and efforts
on the project.

The complete changelog for 1.4.17 is at `Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_1_4_17>`_.

SQLAlchemy 1.4.17 is available on the `Download Page </download.html>`_.
