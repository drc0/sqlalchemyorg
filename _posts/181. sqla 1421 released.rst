title: SQLAlchemy 1.4.21 Released
author: Mike

SQLAlchemy 1.4.21 is now available.

Release 1.4.21 includes a series of improvements within the ORM and Core
components to improve issues regarding column naming in SQL statements and
result sets (see issue #6718 and #6710 in the changelog), as well as an
adjustment to a particular case where the ORM would emit a lazyload during an
attribute set event for one-to-one relationships that's particularly
troublesome when using the asyncio extension; this operation has been changed
to occur only when enabled using the ``active_history`` flag (see issue #6708
in the changelog).

A series of fixes regarding PostgreSQL "ON CONFLICT" statements are also
included.

Thanks to all the users who reported and contributed to this release as well
as the ongoing efforts of our amazing core team.
