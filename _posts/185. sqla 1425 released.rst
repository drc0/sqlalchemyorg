title: SQLAlchemy 1.4.25 Released
author: Mike

SQLAlchemy 1.4.25 is now available.

Release 1.4.25 fixes a single platform installation issue where the platform
names for ``aarch64`` as well as ``AMD64`` on windows only were excluded from
the list of platforms for which the ``greenlet`` dependency, necessary for
SQLAlchemy asyncio support, is required, preventing ``greenlet`` from being
installed automatically for these platforms. The ``greenlet`` dependency may
also be installed manually using the ``sqlalchemy[asyncio]`` installation
target with pip.

The complete changelog for 1.4.25 is at `Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_1_4_25>`_.

SQLAlchemy 1.4.25 is available on the `Download Page </download.html>`_.
