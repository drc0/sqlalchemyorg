title: SQLAlchemy 2.0.1 Released
author: Mike

SQLAlchemy release 2.0.1 is now available.

The release of 2.0 has been very well received, with about half of
daily downloads (600K / day) going to the 2.0 series.    The ORM Declarative
Annotations feature is in particular receiving lots of attention, and the
focus of 2.0 is improvements and fixes to this new system, as well as
ongoing improvements and fixes to the general pep-484 typing now applied
inline within the main source.

The release also repairs one issue within the new "bulk insert" mechanics,
fixing compilation for complex INSERT statements with nested CTEs that may
themselves also include INSERT statements.

The release has otherwise so far been very smooth with only a few trivial
regressions which have been fixed.
