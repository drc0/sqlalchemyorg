SQLAlchemy 1.4.3 is now available.

Release 1.4.3 continues with small fixes and additionally introduces
support for the ``aiosqlite`` asyncio API for SQLite.

Huge thanks to our userbase and core development team for working to make
release 1.4.3 possible.

For users migrating from 1.3, the first stop is the
`What's New in 1.4? <https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/changelog/migration_14.html>`_
document which will provide an overview of how to get started with
SQLAlchemy 1.4.

The complete changelog for 1.4.3 as well as all the beta releases is at
`Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_1_4_3>`_.

SQLAlchemy 1.4.3 is available on the `Download Page </download.html>`_.
