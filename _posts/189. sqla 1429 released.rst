title: SQLAlchemy 1.4.29 Released
author: Mike

SQLAlchemy 1.4.29 is now available.

Release 1.4.29 is released slightly ahead of schedule to accommodate for a fix
for the mypy plugin, which stopped working as a result of a change released in
mypy version 0.390, released earlier today. SQLAlchemy's continuous integration
for mypy was inadvertently disabled which prevented this issue from being
caught, which has been repaired.

Also included are fixes and use case additions for the ORM, asyncio,
engine and MariaDB components.

Our user and contributor communities continue to deliver with bug reports,
fixes and code contributions every day. Thanks much for their dedication and
efforts.

The complete changelog for 1.4.29 is at `Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_1_4_29>`_.

SQLAlchemy 1.4.29 is available on the `Download Page </download.html>`_.
