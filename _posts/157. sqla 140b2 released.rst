The second beta release of the SQLAlchemy 1.4 series, 1.4.0b2, is now available.

Release 1.4.0b2 includes a wide array of continued fixes and additions to
the many new APIs and features released in 1.4.0b1 and adds
new features as well, including:

* support for "table valued" and related SQL function forms, most prominently
  requested for PostgreSQL ARRAY and JSON related functions

* Support for the MySQL aiomysql asyncio driver

* INSERT..ON CONFLICT support for SQLite

* A new variant to ORM Declarative support for Python Dataclasses, allowing
  SQLAlchemy Column, relationship() and other constructs to be used inline
  within Dataclass ``Field()`` objects

* Support for mapper configuration and teardown to be per-``registry()``,
  allowing for example mappings associated with a particular declarative base
  to be configured while not impacting mappers from other bases

* Per-connection logging tokens for debugging concurrent applications

The release also contains a wide array of fixes and missing behaviors from
major new features, including:

* many missing features and behaviors added to the asyncio extension

* bugs and performance improvements for the asyncpg dialect for PostgreSQL.

* A wide array of fixes and architectural improvements to the new "lambda SQL"
  feature that is intrinsic to the ``with_loader_criteria()`` feature

It's hoped that 1.4.0b2 will be the last beta release before 1.4.0 final,
which itself should hopefully be released within the coming weeks.

Some weeks after 1.4.0 final is released, the 2.0 branch will be moved
to main and SQLAlchemy's development as a Python 3 only system supporting
type annotations can begin.

The ultimate goal of the 1.4 / 2.0 series is to make SQLAlchemy
**easier to learn**, **more consistent** and **more reliable**.

A huge number of contributors as well as our core development team has helped
tremendously in getting us to the second beta and everyone deserves our
deepest thanks and gratitude.

The migration guide for SQLAlchemy 1.4 is the best place to start in order
to get an overview of what's happening:  `What's New in 1.4? </docs/14/changelog/migration_14.html>`_.   The complete changelog is at
`Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_1_4_0b2>`_.

SQLAlchemy 1.4.0b2 by naming convention is a beta release, so only installs
with pip if the ``--pre`` flag is included.   Links to pypi for
SQLAlchemy 1.4.0b2 are available on the `Download Page </download.html>`_.
