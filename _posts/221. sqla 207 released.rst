title: SQLAlchemy 2.0.7 Released
author: Mike

SQLAlchemy release 2.0.7 is now available.

Release 2.0.7 includes a critical bugfix in the SQL caching system, where SQL
expressions that made use of the ``.op()`` custom operator construct would not
be appropriately cached; all applications that make use of the ``.op()``
construct are strongly encouraged to upgrade to 2.0.7 (or SQLAlchemy 1.4.47,
which also includes the same fix).

Links to the detailed changelog for 2.0.7 is at `Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_2_0_7>`_.

SQLAlchemy 2.0.7 is available on the `Download Page </download.html>`_.
