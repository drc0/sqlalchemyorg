title: SQLAlchemy 1.4.0b3 Released
author: Mike B

The third beta release of the SQLAlchemy 1.4 series, 1.4.0b3, is now available.

Release 1.4.0b3 includes a few new features and changes.  In particular, a
change has been made to the strategy that names the columns within a
row when using SELECT statements in 2.0 style, so that these names more
directly match what was first requested including when special labeling
scenarios are used.   There are also some additional regression fixes.

While 1.4.0b2 was slated to be the last beta before 1.4.0, we would like to get
some more testing done including the above column naming change, hence the
release of 1.4.0b3. Release 1.4.0 final continues to be expected within the
coming weeks.

Thanks to our many generous contributors as well as our core development team
in getting this beta release and all releases shipped out to the world.

The migration guide for SQLAlchemy 1.4 is the best place to start in order
to get an overview of what's happening:  `What's New in 1.4? </docs/14/changelog/migration_14.html>`_.
The complete changelog is at
`Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_1_4_0b3>`_.

SQLAlchemy 1.4.0b3 by naming convention is a beta release, so only installs
with pip if the ``--pre`` flag is included.   Links to pypi for
SQLAlchemy 1.4.0b3 are available on the `Download Page </download.html>`_.
