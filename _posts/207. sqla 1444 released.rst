SQLAlchemy 1.4.44 is now available.

Release 1.4.44 is being released sooner than usual to provide a fix for a
memory issue identified in the SQL caching system. Applications which have
observed larger than usual memory use since switching to the 1.4.x series are
strongly encouraged to try out version 1.4.44; if observed memory use
decreases, please reach out to us and let us know!

The complete changelog for 1.4.44 is at `Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_1_4_44>`_.

SQLAlchemy 1.4.44 is available on the `Download Page </download.html>`_.
