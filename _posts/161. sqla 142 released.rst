title: SQLAlchemy 1.4.2 Released
author: Mike B
---

SQLAlchemy 1.4.2 is now available.

As the large number of small regressions and new feature issues being reported
has continued beyond version 1.4.1, version 1.4.2 now has the next batch of
fixes. Release 1.4.2 includes mostly more regression fixes, all of which are
"one-liner" fixes, as well as a new use case supported by Dataclasses feature
allowing declarative mixins with ``@declared_attr`` to work as Dataclasses.

Continued thanks to the users submitting great bug reports and our core
development team working all week to solidify the 1.4 release.

For users migrating from 1.3, the first stop is the
`What's New in 1.4? <https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/changelog/migration_14.html>`_
document which will provide an overview of how to get started with
SQLAlchemy 1.4.

The complete changelog for 1.4.2 as well as all the beta releases is at
`Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_1_4_2>`_.

SQLAlchemy 1.4.2 is available on the `Download Page </download.html>`_.
