author: Mike B

SQLAlchemy 1.4.9 is now available.

Release 1.4.9 fixes a critical performance issue regarding the traversal
of deeply nested SELECT statements.  The issue may impact several areas,
including the scan which occurs for a ``Session`` configured to use
"bind per table", which is the pattern used by Flask-SQLAlchemy.

Thanks to our team and users helping us to get everything done for the
1.4 series.

The complete changelog for 1.4.9 is at `Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_1_4_9>`_.

SQLAlchemy 1.4.9 is available on the `Download Page </download.html>`_.
