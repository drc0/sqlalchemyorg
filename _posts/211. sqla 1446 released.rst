title: SQLAlchemy 1.4.46 Released
author: Mike

SQLAlchemy 1.4.46 is now available.

The first release of the new year, SQLAlchemy 1.4.46 fixes a few fairly
important issues, including an issue which could in unlikely circumstances
impact connection pool stability for applications that use gevent or eventlet.

Release 1.4.46 is also a step towards the first release of SQLAlchemy 2.0
final, expected this month, introducing a new deprecation warning that emits
exactly once when the application in use makes use of an API removed from 2.0,
when the ``SQLALCHEMY_WARN_20`` environment variable is not otherwise set. This
deprecation warning is intended to give users that may not be following the
progress of 2.0 that their requirements files should ensure SQLAlchemy 2.0
won't be installed prematurely.

The complete changelog for 1.4.46 is at `Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_1_4_46>`_.

SQLAlchemy 1.4.46 is available on the `Download Page </download.html>`_.
