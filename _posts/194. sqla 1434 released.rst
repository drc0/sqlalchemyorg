SQLAlchemy 1.4.34 is now available.

Release 1.4.34 repairs a regression in the now-yanked 1.4.33 release where
running an ``insert()`` construct via the ``Session.execute()`` method
would fail if the statement contained ORM entities. An additional adjustment
to improve psycopg2 "executemany mode" is also present.

The complete changelog for 1.4.34 is at `Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_1_4_34>`_.

SQLAlchemy 1.4.34 is available on the `Download Page </download.html>`_.
