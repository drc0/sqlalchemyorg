SQLAlchemy 1.4.32 is now available.

Release 1.4.32 contains a fairly long series of fixes, quite a few in the area
of correct error reporting for various error conditions. It also includes
updates to accommodate changes in recent versions of cx_Oracle and
mariadbconnector, as well as improvements to the test suite to correct for
issues encountered within third party packaging and integration environments.

Development on SQLAlchemy 2.0 continues with recent emphasis on new
typing-oriented mapping styles and overall pep-484 support throughout the whole
library.

The complete changelog for 1.4.32 is at `Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_1_4_32>`_.
