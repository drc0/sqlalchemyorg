title: SQLAlchemy 1.4.4 Released
author: Mike B
---

SQLAlchemy 1.4.4 is now available.

Release 1.4.4 includes a short set of mostly minor bug fixes, and a small fix
for one significant issue in the new ``PropComparator.and_()`` method which can
be used to apply custom criteria to relationship loads where bound parameters
would not be applied correctly.

The primary development effort within the 1.4 series is further fixes
and improvements to the Mypy plugin as well as the related
``sqlalchemy2-stubs`` package.  Upcoming fixes to those features
involve more significant development of new test suites so are **not**
included in 1.4.4 as of yet.   Mypy plugin work continues to go well
as some difficult issues integrating with Mypy have been figured out.

Huge thanks to our userbase and core development team for working to make
release 1.4.4 possible.

For users migrating from 1.3, the first stop is the
`What's New in 1.4? <https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/changelog/migration_14.html>`_
document which will provide an overview of how to get started with
SQLAlchemy 1.4.
