title: SQLAlchemy 2.0.9 Released

SQLAlchemy release 2.0.9 is now available.

Release 2.0.9 is an emergency release which includes a critical fix for
SQL Server.  The "insertmanyvalues" feature has been disabled for this
backend, as a bug has been identified in SQL Server itself which under
some circumstances will cause the multi-row INSERT statement to insert
rows in a non-deterministic order vs. the order in which they are
indicated in the parameter list, which can lead to incorrect persistence
decisions and possible data corruption.
