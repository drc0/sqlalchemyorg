title: SQLAlchemy 1.4.13 Released
author: Mike B
---

SQLAlchemy 1.4.13 is now available.

Release 1.4.13 is being made ahead of some more usage-oriented changes
to push out fixes for the latest series of regressions, which continue
to result from the very broad array of internal changes for the
1.4/2.0 series interacting with various use cases reported by the userbase
which weren't specifically tested; all the regressions continue to be small
tweaks for various unanticipated conditions.

Progress also continues with sqlalchemy2-stubs which continues to be
released independently.

We'd like to thank our users, contributors and core developers for keeping
the momemtum going stronger than ever.
