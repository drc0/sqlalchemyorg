title: SQLAlchemy 1.4.39 Released
author: Mike

SQLAlchemy 1.4.39 is now available.

Release 1.4.39 fixes a single issue in 1.4.38 which is that a fix to the
``sqlalchemy.ext.mutable`` extension involving pickling failed to accommodate
for the previous pickling format, which would impact an in-place upgrade
of SQLAlchemy from 1.4.37 to 1.4.38 in an application that refers to existing
pickled ORM objects, such as if they were stored in a cache.   As SQLAlchemy's
creator has at times been hit with this issue in production in days very
long ago, we are rushing out a fix in 1.4.39 so that the legacy format for
the "mutable" construct will remain consumable.

The complete changelog for 1.4.39 is at `Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_1_4_39>`_.
