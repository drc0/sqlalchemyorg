SQLAlchemy 1.4.35 is now available.

Release 1.4.35 repairs a critical regression in the now-yanked 1.4.34 release
which could cause incorrect bound parameter values to be rendered due to
a caching issue caused by the memory performance improvement first released
in version 1.4.35.  1.4.35 is recommended for all users currently
running 1.4.33 or 1.4.34.

The complete changelog for 1.4.35 is at `Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_1_4_35>`_.

SQLAlchemy 1.4.35 is available on the `Download Page </download.html>`_.
