SQLAlchemy 1.4.33 is now available.   (update: this release was yanked due
to a regression involving ORM-enabled INSERT statements.  1.4.34 is
released to repair this.)

Release 1.4.33 contains a wide variety of fixes and improvements, including
a significant reduction in memory use by ORM mappings, as well as an
improvement to the ``Engine.dispose()`` feature which allows for better
integration in multiprocessing environments.

The complete changelog for 1.4.33 is at `Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_1_4_33>`_.

SQLAlchemy 1.4.33 is available on the `Download Page </download.html>`_.
