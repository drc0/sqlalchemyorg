title: SQLAlchemy 1.3.22 Released
author: Mike B

SQLAlchemy release 1.3.22 is now available.

An immediate release of 1.3.22 was necessary due to a regression in the Oracle
dialect, where the new isolation level feature would result in a connectivity
failure for Oracle database connections that do not have access to the
``v$transactions`` system view which is a common scenario for Oracle. The new
logic will gracefully degrade to the pre-1.3.21 behavior if this view is not
available or if any other errors occur while retrieving the default isolation
level.

As is the case with all releases, we'd like to thank all the contributors who
helped to quickly identify this issue.

Changelog for 1.3.22 is at `Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_1_3_22>`_.
