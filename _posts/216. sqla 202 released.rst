SQLAlchemy release 2.0.2 is now available.

After less than a week, another batch of bug fixes and improvements,
mostly involving new Declarative features is ready to download.

One particular issue in this release was an identified issue with the
connection pool under asyncio when using the asyncpg database driver;
the pool would not gracefully report the condition when a pooled connection
was not correctly returned to the pool, which has been fixed.

Links to the detailed changelog for 2.0.2 is at `Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_2_0_2>`_.

SQLAlchemy 2.0.2 is available on the `Download Page </download.html>`_.
