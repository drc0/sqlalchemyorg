SQLAlchemy 1.4.31 is now available.

Release 1.4.31 is an immediate fix to two regressions caused by 1.4.30, the
first involving the PostgreSQL ARRAY datatype when used with ENUM contents, the
second a regression in the ``asyncmy`` dialect which was missed by a broken CI
configuration failing to test the dialect fully, where the removal of the
``pymysql`` dependency caused it to have a missing ``Binary`` symbol.

Thanks to the community for reporting these two regressions quickly and
helping us get htem fixed!

The complete changelog for 1.4.31 is at `Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_1_4_31>`_.
