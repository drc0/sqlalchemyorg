SQLAlchemy 1.4.36 is now available.

Release 1.4.36 includes a variety of bugfixes, including one recent ORM related
regression, as well as a memory leak issue in the now-deprecated C extensions
that had gone unnoticed for many years, triggered by interpreting a ``Row``
object as a NumPy array among other cases involving fetching of non-present
attributes.

The complete changelog for 1.4.36 is at `Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_1_4_36>`_.

SQLAlchemy 1.4.36 is available on the `Download Page </download.html>`_.
