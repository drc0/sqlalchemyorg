author: Mike
---

SQLAlchemy 1.4.24 is now available.

Notable highlights for 1.4.24 include:

* A new driver for the ``asyncmy`` asynchronous database driver is added.  This
  driver is added in response to compatibility issues in the ``aiomysql``
  project which remain unaddressed.
* ORM loader options can now be used with the ``Session.merge()`` and
  ``AsyncSession.merge()`` methods.
* A new method ``Session.scalars`` and ``AsyncSession.scalars`` is added to
  provide for retrieving a scalar-based result, typically for ORM objects.

Thanks to our user and contributor communities for their ongoing help
and support and our core team for their excellent work.
