title: SQLAlchemy 1.4.42 Released

SQLAlchemy 1.4.42 is now available.

Release 1.4.42 includes a variety of bug fixes mostly in the area of ORM
related use cases. Two new ORM related configurational warnings are added as
well, indicating situations that can otherwise lead to confusing behavior in
some cases when the incorrect mappings are used. While it's likely that
some existing setups may have either of these patterns in place and will see
the new warnings, these mis-configuration patterns have been possible for many
years and don't indicate any new issue for existing applications.


Additionally fixed ongoing regressions regarding the MSSQL dialect in
attempting to connect to various forms of Azure cloud databases, where fixes
for one type of Azure database then introduce new problems connecting to
another kind.   The SQLAlchemy project doesn't have direct testing resources
for these databases so we can only rely upon user feedback to know what's
working, however it's very likely the issues are finally resolved in this
release.
