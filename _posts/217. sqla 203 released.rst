SQLAlchemy release 2.0.3 is now available.

This release fixes a critical regression identified in the SQL expression
mechanics, where correct parenthesization would fail to be applied to
individual compound elements of a larger compound expression which featured
more than two elements joined together by a common operator.

Release 2.0.3 is strongly recommended for all current users of the 2.0
series.

SQLAlchemy 2.0.3 is available on the `Download Page </download.html>`_.
