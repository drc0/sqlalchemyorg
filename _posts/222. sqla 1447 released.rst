title: SQLAlchemy 1.4.47 Released
author: Mike
---

SQLAlchemy 1.4.47 is now available.

Release 1.4.47 includes a critical bugfix in the SQL caching system, backported
from version 2.0.7, where SQL expressions that made use of the ``op()`` custom
operator construct would not be appropriately cached; all applications that
make use of the ``.op()`` construct are strongly encouraged to upgrade to
1.4.47 (the same fix is in the 2.0 series at version 2.0.7).

Release 1.4.47 also includes a series of other fixes and backports from the
2.0 release series.

The complete changelog for 1.4.47 is at `Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_1_4_47>`_.

SQLAlchemy 1.4.47 is available on the `Download Page </download.html>`_.
