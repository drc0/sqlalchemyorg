SQLAlchemy 1.4.20 is now available.

Release 1.4.20 fixes a range of small issues most of which involve fairly
specific use cases. There is also one regression that is fixed due to
an ORM related adjustment from release 1.4.19 in the area of deferred columns
rendering within subqueries.

Thanks to all the users who reported and contributed to this release as well
as the ongoing efforts of our amazing core team.

The complete changelog for 1.4.20 is at `Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_1_4_20>`_.

SQLAlchemy 1.4.20 is available on the `Download Page </download.html>`_.
