author: Mike B

SQLAlchemy 1.4.6 is now available.

Continuing with the fastest series of SQLAlchemy releases ever, 1.4.6
has a handful of fixes, two of which are further small but potentially
impactful regressions from the 1.3 series.

Release 1.4.6 has additional fixes for LIMIT/OFFSET queries on Oracle
and SQL Server as well as a fix to the methodology of the "yield_per" feature
when used with the legacy ORM ``Query`` object.

Also included are significant improvements to the stability of the Mypy
plugin.

Huge thanks to our userbase and core development team for working to make
release 1.4.6 possible.
