title: SQLAlchemy 1.4.23 Released
author: Mike

SQLAlchemy 1.4.23 is now available.

Release 1.4.23 has a significant number of fixes and improvements.   Notable
changes include:

* The ``greenlet`` dependency used by the ``asyncio`` extension now will
  install by default only on common platforms where ``greenlet`` is
  known to be supported; if asyncio support is needed on less common
  architectures, the ``sqlalchemy[asyncio]`` target
  needs to be stated explicitly when installing with pip.
* Support is improved for the ``sqlalchemy2-stubs`` package by allowing
  declaration of "generic" types against SQLAlchemy classes at runtime
* Changes have been made to the "selectinload" and "lazyload" loader strategies
  to accommodate various loader and user-defined options scenarios more
  correctly, by implementing a simplification of these strategies to
  no longer use the "lambda caching" feature internally.
* Added a new parameter ``maintain_column_froms`` to the ``Select.with_only_columns``
  method so that it is easier to change the columns being SELECTed from
  without altering the FROM list.

Thanks to our user and contributor communities for their ongoing help
and support and our core team for their excellent work.
