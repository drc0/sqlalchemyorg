title: SQLAlchemy 2.0.0b4 Released
author: Mike

The fourth beta release of **SQLAlchemy 2.0** is now available.

Version 2.0.0b4 should hopefully have the new Declarative features in
ready-for-release quality; many issues regarding different styles of
annotations as well as different scenarios using Dataclasses have been reported
and fixed, as well as a range of typing related fixes and improvements to
continue to allow for full strict typing without the need for plugins.

There's additionally new improvements within the schema, SQL rendering and SQL
type systems and several other improvements and fixes that have either already
been released in SQLAlchemy 1.4.44 or will be in SQLAlchemy 1.4.45; the
changelogs for 2.0.0b3 and 2.0.0b4 now note additional issues that were
backported to the 1.4 series.

The release of 2.0 final is hoped to be mid January of 2023.

The 2.0 series is at this point very close to an approximate "feature freeze",
having accumulated a series of changes that will likely lead to a long period
of adjustment once released; while the beta releases typically see a few
thousand downloads per day, the 1.4 releases average about **1.3 million per
day** on a weekday, so the download base for SQLAlchemy 2.0 is expected to
multiply by at least 10000% within the first few months; new issues and usage
questions are expected to be extremely heavy after the release, as 2.0
has most backwards-incompatible changes of any SQLAlchemy release.

Users looking to upgrade to SQLAlchemy 2.0 are encouraged to work through the
`2.0 Migration Guide <https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/changelog/migration_20.html>`,
which will allow the vast majority of applications that run under SQLAlchemy
1.4 to run completely under SQLAlchemy 2.0; from that point, additional
migrations towards new 2.0 Declarative mappings can be undertaken, allowing for
full typing support of ORM mappings without plugins. These migrations are are
described in the
`Whats New in SQLAlchemy 2.0? <https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/changelog/whatsnew_20.html>`_
document, along with other migration notes for new features and other less
central API changes, such as a new API for PostgreSQL RANGE datatypes.
