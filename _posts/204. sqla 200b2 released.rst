The second beta release of **SQLAlchemy 2.0** is now available.

The first beta release just one week ago has seen unprecedented response for a
beta, with around 5000 downloads per day. Thanks to our users, in the past
seven days we've gotten about ten bug reports for small issues that have been
fixed in 2.0.b2.

Of note is a fix for SQL Server that affected
large string values, as well as a variety of rudimentary fixes for the new
annotation-based Declarative feature including dataclasses support.

For an overview of whats new in SQLAlchemy 2.0, see the
`Whats New in SQLAlchemy 2.0? <https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/changelog/whatsnew_20.html>`_
document.
