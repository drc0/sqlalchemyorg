SQLAlchemy 1.4.26 is now available.

Release 1.4.26 is chock full of a number of bug fixes as the 1.4 release
has settled into general use.   Key fixes in release 1.4.26 include:

* a repair to the workings of the ``update()`` statement in an ORM context
  when used with hybrid and composite attributes.

* Fixes for the ``with_loader_criteria()`` ORM option

* adjustments to the ORM Session interface to accommodate for new API features

* some new legacy warnings for lesser used patterns with ``Query.join()``

* SQL / ORM fixes for the use case of selecting from repeated, non-labeled
  column expressions, typically the ``null()`` construct when used as a
  placeholder in a UNION statement.

* For PostgreSQL, refinements to the "expanding IN"
  SQL feature when used with PostgreSQL ARRAY datatypes as well as fixes
  for the mostly PostgreSQL-specific ``any_()`` and ``all_()`` column methods.

* For MySQL, repaired support for new behaviors in MariaDB 10.6

* For SQL Server, reflection fixes and improvements for foreign key constraints
  as well table /view detection.

As is always the case, huge thanks to our user and contributor communities as
for their ongoing help and support as well as to our core team for their
dedicated efforts and hard work.
