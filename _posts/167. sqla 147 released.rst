title: SQLAlchemy 1.4.7 Released
author: Mike B
---

SQLAlchemy 1.4.7 is now available.

Release 1.4.7 includes two ORM related fixes relating to
the "autobegin" feature of the ``Session`` as well as some new eager loading
features, and is recommended for all users of the ORM.

While the releases are coming fast as we get 1.4 fully adapted to an ever
growing expanse of existing SQLAlchemy codebases, every release still
relies on our great userbase and core dev team to report, triage and fix as
fast as possible; thanks to everyone involved.

The complete changelog for 1.4.7 is at `Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_1_4_7>`_.

SQLAlchemy 1.4.7 is available on the `Download Page </download.html>`_.
