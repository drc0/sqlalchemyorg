title: SQLAlchemy 1.4.15 Released
author: Mike

SQLAlchemy 1.4.15 is now available.

Release 1.4.15 fixes a fairly serious issue with the ``subqueryload()``
loader strategy that was causing it to not correctly use SQL caching, which
would degrade the usefulness of the caching feature overall.   A small number
of other fixes and enhancements are also included.

Thanks to our users and developers for their continued support and efforts
on the project.

The complete changelog for 1.4.15 is at `Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_1_4_15>`_.

SQLAlchemy 1.4.15 is available on the `Download Page </download.html>`_.
