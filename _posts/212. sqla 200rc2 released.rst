The second release candidate of **SQLAlchemy 2.0** is now available.

Version 2.0.0rc2 includes a small number of relatively minor changes.
In particular the MySQL/MariaDB dialect repair a regression that lasted
throughout the 1.4 series where the ``Inspector.has_table()`` method would
not report on the existence of temp tables.

2.0 final is still anticipated for sometime this month.
