SQLAlchemy 1.4.19 is now available.

Release 1.4.19 includes a variety of bug fixes in areas such as
asyncio support, ORM use, the Mypy plugin, and some dialect-level fixes.
In asyncio in particular, an issue was fixed that prevented the
``asyncio.CancelledError`` from being intercepted correctly within engine-level
error handling, leading to stability issues for applications and web containers
that make use of this condition to halt tasks.

Thanks to our users and developers for their continued support and efforts
on the project.

The complete changelog for 1.4.19 is at `Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_1_4_19>`_.
