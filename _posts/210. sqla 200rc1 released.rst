title: SQLAlchemy 2.0.0rc1 Released
author: Mike

The first release candidate of **SQLAlchemy 2.0** is now available.

Version 2.0.0rc1 is hoped to be very close to the final 2.0.0 release which
is anticipated in January.   A few additional changes have been added
since the 2.0.0b4 release, mostly in the area of ``Session`` behavior.

Users of SQLAlchemy 1.4 should ensure that their production requirements.txt
files are capped in the 1.4 series, so that the final 2.0.0 release doesn't
result in sudden changes due to surprise upgrades; upgrades from 1.4.x to
2.0.x should always be tested, even if the full migration steps were completed
for the 1.4 series.

Users looking to upgrade to SQLAlchemy 2.0 are encouraged to work through the
`2.0 Migration Guide <https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/changelog/migration_20.html>`,
which will allow the vast majority of applications that run under SQLAlchemy
1.4 to run completely under SQLAlchemy 2.0.   SQLAlchemy 2.0
may have additional behaviors and API adjustments that as always should be
tested against the 2.0 release itself.
