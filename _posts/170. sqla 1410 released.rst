SQLAlchemy 1.4.10 is now available.

Release 1.4.10 includes a handful of bug fixes and some use case additions,
including one ORM related regression involving the new "eager load on refresh"
feature which could overwrite non-flushed changes if autoflush were set to
false.

Thanks to our team and users helping us to get everything done for the
1.4 series.

The complete changelog for 1.4.10 is at `Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_1_4_10>`_.
