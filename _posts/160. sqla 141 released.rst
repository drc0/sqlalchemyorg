title: SQLAlchemy 1.4.1 Released

SQLAlchemy 1.4.1 is now available.

The response to the SQLAlchemy 1.4.0 release has been large and enthusiastic.
In a testament to how widely used it is, within one day we got plenty of new
issue reports for mostly small and fairly edge-case issues like naming
conflicts introduced by new APIs and such. SQLAlchemy 1.4.1 has the first batch
of fixes for these issues, as well as a fix for a more serious regression
involving lazy loading in highly dynamic mapper configurations which has been
identified and repaired.

Thanks to our many generous contributors as well as our core development team
for turning around this quick fix release; there's still much more to do
so more releases are on the way.

For users migrating from 1.3, the first stop is the
`What's New in 1.4? <https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/changelog/migration_14.html>`_
document which will provide an overview of how to get started with
SQLAlchemy 1.4.

The complete changelog for 1.4.1 as well as all the beta releases is at
`Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_1_4_1>`_.

SQLAlchemy 1.4.1 is available on the `Download Page </download.html>`_.
