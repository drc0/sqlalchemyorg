SQLAlchemy 1.4.11 is now available.

Release 1.4.11 fixes a critical race condition in the ``Engine`` class
which ensures that the dialect is fully initialized upon first connect before
other concurrent threads can begin to use the dialect.

Thanks to our team and users helping us to get everything done for the
1.4 series.

The complete changelog for 1.4.11 is at `Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_1_4_11>`_.

SQLAlchemy 1.4.11 is available on the `Download Page </download.html>`_.
