author: Mike B

SQLAlchemy 1.4.11 is now available.

Release 1.4.11 adds a fix for critical race condition in the ``Engine`` class,
ensuring that the dialect is fully initialized upon first connect before
other concurrent threads can begin to use the dialect as was the behavior
in 1.3.x.

Thanks to our team and users helping us to get everything done for the
1.4 series.

The complete changelog for 1.4.11 is at `Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_1_4_11>`_.

SQLAlchemy 1.4.11 is available on the `Download Page </download.html>`_.
